The Java program runs with IntelliJ, and uses Facebook as example website.

The most important part of the code is the "Robot" class, part of the AWK package. With this class the button presses, such as Mouse right-click is replaced with Mouse operations. In this way the user does not need to do the regular mouse-right click, etc. operations, when he/she wants to copy the locator from the website. 

At the end of using the program, the locators those were saved with the Mouse presses, are written to the newly created locators.java Page Object Model file.
